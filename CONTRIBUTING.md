# Contributing to felipesdev.github.io
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! I'm really glad with your attempt! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainer if that's a concern.
